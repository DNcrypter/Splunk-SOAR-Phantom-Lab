## üçÅIntroduction
In this Lab I will try to cover how can we install Splunk SOAR, and how we can configure it to play automation of threat response.

## üçÅWhat is SOAR ?
The SOAR stands for security orchestration, automation, and response. The SOAR platform provided by Splunk is known as Phantom. Earlier it used to have a different website but now has been integrated into the Splunk‚Äôs official website itself.

## üçÅPrerequisites
- Basic knowledge of command-line
- Familiar with Centos or RHEL operating system

## üçÅRequirements
- Requires centos 7 / RHEL 8 or later
- VMware or Virtualbox

## üçÅInstall the Splunk SOAR
**Step 1**: Create a RHEL 8 machine with the user name phantom.

**Step 2**: During the installation of RHEL 8, on the UI while creating a user enter the user name and password but don‚Äôt give it administrative rights at the beginning.

**Step 3**: Install the splunk-soar-unpriv file.
ou can Download the unprivileged installer from ‚Äúhttps://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/soar-free-trial.html?locale=en_us‚Äù after creating an account and starting the free trial.

You can directly copy the wget link and run it on the linux machine or follow **Step 3**.

**Step 4**: Go to directory where you downloaded splunk SOAR file. By default it is in Download directory.
```
cd Download
```
**Step 5**: Unzip the tar file.
```
tar -xzvf ./<splunk_soar_version>
```
Now wait for one or two minutes until it get unzip the file.

**Step 6**: Move uzipped file to /opt/soar/ path.
```
cp ./<splunk_soar_version> /opt/soar/
```
As we installed the RHEL and unzipped the unprivileged splunk soar package on our system.


## üçÅConfigure the SOAR

**Step 1**: I used ‚Äúchmod -R 777 /opt/‚Äù because it is a test environment and permissions are essential for unprivileged installation.

**Step 2**: This step might be optional but if you have encountered a problem, you may need to disable SELinux.

**Step 3**: Check firewalls daemon is running ‚Äúsystemctl status firewalld‚Äù . If the daemon is not running use the following commands:
```
sudo yum install firewalls
sudo systemctl start firewalls
sudo systemctl enable firewalld
```

**Step 4**: Update operating system:
```
sudo yum clean all
```
```
sudo yum update
```

Login as a root and start the script using the following command for unprivileged installation.
```
./soar-prepare-system ‚Äî splunk-soar-home /opt/soar/ ‚Äî https-port 8443
```

**Step 5**: In the script, it will ask for the creation of a user. give username and password.

which port will be used (default is 8443)?

**Step 6**: You can give ‚ÄúY‚Äù for all options except cluster options. you can give different answers according to question asked.

Give ‚Äún‚Äù this question.

**Step 7**: This is an unprivileged installation, therefore switch the user that you were created during the installation phase. Note that, do NOT install SOAR as a root user.
```
./soar-install ‚Äî splunk-soar-home /opt/soar ‚Äî https-port 8443

```

**Step 8**: You can Ignore errors and give ‚Äúy‚Äù.

At the end you will get completed installation message.

**Step 9**: Start phantom services via ‚Äú./start.phantom.sh‚Äù. Scripts are in the bin folder.

**Step 10**: You can access the SOAR interface ‚Äúlocalhost:8443‚Äù.
